Directory Structure : 
---------------------
{Vue JS Directory names and it's explaination}

Reasons To Use VueJS : 
----------------------
-Fast Rendering
-Improved TypeScript
-use Composition API
-Workflow Strategy

Advantages of VueJS : 
---------------------
Reusable Functionalities.
SSR and SSG Supportive.
Single Page Application (SPA)

emit => Children to Parent Data Passing
props => Parent to Child Data Passing

LifeCycle Hooks in VueJS : 
---------------------------

created():
----------
-created hook is called when a Vue component is created, but before it is inserted into the DOM.
-used to perform component setup, such as initializing data, setting up watchers or computed properties, 
  making API calls, or performing other setup tasks that need to be executed when the component is created.
-it is not called when the component is updated or re-rendered

mounted():
----------
-the mounted lifecycle hook is a special function that gets called automatically after a Vue component has been inserted into the DOM.
-you can use the mounted hook to fetch data from a server, initialize third-party libraries, set up event listeners, 
 or perform other tasks that need to be executed after the component has been rendered in the DOM
-It's important to note that the mounted hook is only called once, when the component is initially inserted into the DOM. 
 If the component is later updated or re-rendered, the mounted hook will not be called again.

updated():
----------
-the updated lifecycle hook is a special function that gets called automatically after a Vue component 
    has been re-rendered due to changes in its data or props. 
-these hook is functions that are automatically executed at different points during the lifecycle of a Vue component.

computed():
-----------
- a computed property is a type of property that is derived from other properties or data in the Vue instance or component, 
    and its value is automatically calculated and updated whenever the dependent properties change.
-Computed properties are reactive, which means that they automatically update when their
    dependent data changes, without needing to be explicitly called or watched.
-important thing to note is that computed properties are cached, meaning that their values are only 
    recalculated when their dependent data properties change



Modes : 
--------
3 types of Mode Available in Vue-cli-service
-development
-test
-production


How Props works in VueJS : 
--------------------------
into the child component, define props and use to render that prop 
props: {
    propName: String // Define prop and its type
}
Inside the parent component >
import child component (import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent.vue';)
define component (components: {ChildComponent})
return the prop value data() {return {propValue: 'Hello from parent component!' // Data to be passed as props }; }
and you can use to show the value you have return in child component : 
<!-- Use the child component and pass data as props -->
<child-component :propName="propValue"></child-component>


Slots in VueJS : 
----------------

#Simple Method for Slot
Write piece of code in a saprate file and in between write <slot /> to make that component a slot 
import in another file where you want to use that slot with it's file name (import BtnSlot from './BtnSlot.vue')
define it in component (components: {BtnSlot})
and write slot in template (<BtnSlot> ButtonName Here </BtnSlot>)

#Named Slot
Create File with name BaseSlot.vue and write multiple slots with attributes called name ( <header><slot name="header"></slot></header>)
import in another file where you want to use that slot with it's file name (import BaseSlot from './BaseSlot.vue')
define it in component (components: {BaseSlot})
now to use named slot , use that component name as tag in template tag & inside that use another template tag with attribute 
starts with # and named slot name which you have given as a property of attribute in BaseSlot.vue
<BaseLayout>
    <template #header>
      <h1>Here might be a page title</h1>
    </template>
</BaseLayout>

#Dynamic Slot

#Scoped Slots


Vue Best Practices : 
--------------------
how to mame it work with efficency and reusablity
    make components and use methods ad props
    use insted of using core functinalities to avoide long code.

    let's take an example to show on that in vepaar
        VueForm used with the methods like save del get .....
        insted of using long functions for buttons and calls

Components are Registered globally in src/global.js
computed properties can use as a value of ..

Make an seprative things goes up
    code splitting makes works 

Use Slots For Small Idel Designs
Use Componennts For Small Components 

understand all the property with it's attributes and parent componentns and slots
use the componnent in script tag is works as a good habit.


$functions in VueJS : 
----------------------
whhile using dollar function at the way of aquring some goal , we will ge some function data and that we gonna use with the
actually it's a parameter that called by the specific sign like dollor

like there is a $event
$option is used for non reactive data in a vue component. Vue put hidden watcher on data members that's why we use $options .


Why ssr needed ?
----------------
ssr means Server Side Render is very important and needed at the forntend level.
the specific piece of code constraints the data that must include the berave of the system.



State Management : 
------------------
what is state : Values of certain properties

What ? : state management refers to the management of data that is shared across multiple components in your application. 
Why ? :  It becomes especially important when your application grows in complexity and you need a centralized approach to manage and synchronize data between different components.

Vuex : 
------
VueX helps you manage state in a predictable manner and provides a centralized store where your application's data is stored.

Here are the key concepts and components of VueX:

State: The state represents the single source of truth for your application's data. It is stored in a central store and can be accessed by any component in your application.
Getters: Getters allow you to compute derived state based on the store's state. They are similar to computed properties in Vue components but are available at the store level. Getters are useful for filtering, sorting, or transforming the data stored in the state.
Mutations: Mutations are synchronous functions that modify the state. They are the only way to modify the state in a VueX store and should be used to ensure that changes to the state are tracked and can be debugged. Mutations must be committed using a commit function.
Actions: Actions are asynchronous functions that can perform logic, make API requests, and commit mutations. Actions are usually used when you need to perform asynchronous operations before committing mutations to the state. Actions are dispatched using the dispatch function.
Modules: Modules allow you to split your store into smaller, reusable modules, each with its own state, getters, mutations, and actions. Modules can be nested, allowing you to create a hierarchical structure for your store.
