-> React is javaScript library
-> use build single page application
-> allow us to reusable UI components.
-> Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.
-> React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.

> Create React App

=> how to setup react environment in comuter?

-> use create-react-app
-> create-react-app tool is support to create react application .
-> command - npx create-react-app react application name

What is React JS? 

React is frontend javaScript framework is JavaScript library created by facebook

tool building UI components


 How does React Work? 

react is vertual dom browser memory

reaact create virtual DOM in memory, it does all necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

what is ES6

ES6 = ECMAScript6

ECMAScript created standarlized JavaScript.

React ES6 Classes


class is one type of function 
we use keyword class and properties are assigned inside a constructor() method

class name first letter upper case

example
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");

document.write(mycar.brand);

Method in Classes

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");
document.write(mycar.present());
</script>

-> you can see in the example above, you call the method by referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses (parameters would go inside the parentheses).

Class Inheritance

-> use extends keyword to create class Inheritance
-> a class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class

example 
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(name, mod) {
    super(name);
    this.model = mod;
  }  
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
  }
}

const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
document.write(mycar.show());

=> super() method to represent parent class
=> call super() method in constructor method we call th parent's constructor method add get access to the parent's constructor method and get acess parent's method

==================================================================

ES6 Arrow Function 

aroe function is write shorter function syntax

example for function
hello = function(){
    return"Hello"
}

example for arrow function

hello =() =>{
    return "Hello";
}

Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
hello = () => "Hello World!";

you have parameters, you pass then inside the parentheses
hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = hello("World");

What About this?

The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
with arrow function , the this keyword always represent the object that defined the arrow function
