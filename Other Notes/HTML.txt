-HTML Tag consists of two components: the first is the content, and the second is the tag. Together, they help display pages with the required information.
-HTML Components : head, body, comment, title, and many more tags that use to define html document for web page.
-HTML Tags : it use to define the format that how browser will display it differently 
-HTML Elements : Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements

-Block level elements : Block elements always start from a new line. <div>, <img>, <section>, <form>, <nav>
-Inline Elements : Inline elements never start from a new line.<span>,<br>

-block:A block-level element is drawn as a block that stretches to fill the full width available to it i.e, the width of its container and will always start on a new line.
	Elements that are block-level by default: <div>, <img>, <section>, <form>, <nav>.
-Inline : Inline elements are drawn where they are defined and only take up space that is absolutely needed. 
The easiest way to understand how they work is to look at how text flows on a page.
	Examples of elements that are inline by default: <span>, <b>, <strong>, <a>, <input>.

-<meter> tag and <progress> : 
	<progress> tag should be used when we want to show the completion progress of a task, whereas if we just want a scalar m
	easurement within a known range or fraction value. Also, we can specify multiple extra attributes 
	for <meter> tags like ‘form’, ‘low’, ‘high’, ‘min’, etc.

What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?
It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. 
It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. 
If the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px
